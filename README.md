# react_basics

## This repo is for studying React through sample projects

when putting these on ipage you will have to:
```
npm run build
```
then edit the index.html file in the build to make the links to files and folders relative links; e.g.:
```
href="/static/css/main.69250bc6.chunk.css"
```
to
```
href="./static/css/main.69250bc6.chunk.css" 
```
etc.
